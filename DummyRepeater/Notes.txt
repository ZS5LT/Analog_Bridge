Sound:
You do not need a real sound device to use DummyRepeater with AllStarLink. DummyRepeater will work with a "dummy" sound device.
Add snd-dummy to /etc/modules and reboot or run modprobe snd-dummy
aplay-l will show you your sound devices
root@d-star:/etc# aplay -l
**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
card 2: Dummy [Dummy], device 0: Dummy PCM [Dummy PCM]

To make this the default for alsamixer etc, create /etc/asound.conf
defaults.pcm.card 2
defaults.ctl.card 2
The number comes from the output of aplay -l

In DummyRepeater/Preferences/Sound Card you should see  Dummy PCM (Dummy) select it and restart DummyRepeater

Note: you can enable the onboard sound output device for a local monitor (speaker)
This is outside of the scope of these notes.

Video:
DummyRepeater unlike ircDDBGateway and RemoreControl, does not have a daemon version. It requires a display. You can "fake this" using a virtual frame buffer.
Install it using apt-get install xvfb.
Start it in the background with Xvfb -shmem -screen 0 1280x1024x24 &
You can then run DummyRepeater with DISPLAY=:0 dummyrepeater

You can automate this.
This is outside of the scope of these notes.
