Buiing DummyRepeater:
Checkout OpenDV from https://github.com/dl5di/OpenDV
Replace OpenDV/DummyRepeater/DummyRepeater/DummyRepeaterThread.cpp with DummyRepeaterThread.cpp from this repository
add required libraries:
apt-get install libwxgtk3.0-dev libusb-1.0

cd OpenDV/DummyRepeater
./configure
make
If all went well:
make install

The modified version of DummyRepeater will use the USRP channel driver from AllStarLink (Just like Analog_Bridge)
DummyRepeater will use the default UDP ports for TX and RX. It uses address 127.0.0.1 as defined by the USRP channel driver.
If you need to use other ports or addresses, you can define them in the enviorment before you start dummyrepeter.

USRP_IP="127.0.0.1";export USRP_IP
USRP_TXPORT=34001;export USRP_TXPORT
USRP_RXPORT=32001;export USRP_RXPORT

These can be permanent or run from a script.

Modify your node stanza so that you do NOT put ASL telemetry out on D-Star. Use this as a example:
https://github.com/N4IRS/Analog_Bridge/blob/master/rpt.conf.txt

Sound:
You do not need a real sound device to use DummyRepeater with AllStarLink. DummyRepeater will work with a "dummy" sound device.
Add snd-dummy to /etc/modules and reboot or run modprobe snd-dummy
aplay -l will show your sound devices
root@d-star:/etc# aplay -l
**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
card 2: Dummy [Dummy], device 0: Dummy PCM [Dummy PCM]

To make this the default for alsamixer etc, create /etc/asound.conf
defaults.pcm.card 2
defaults.ctl.card 2
The number comes from the output of aplay -l

In DummyRepeater/Preferences/Sound Card you should see  Dummy PCM (Dummy) select it and restart DummyRepeater

Note: you can enable the onboard sound output device for a local monitor (speaker)
This is outside of the scope of these notes.

Video:
DummyRepeater unlike ircDDBGateway and RemoreControl, does not have a daemon version. It requires a display. You can "fake this" using a virtual frame buffer.
Install it using apt-get install xvfb.
Start it in the background with Xvfb -shmem -screen 0 1280x1024x24 &
You can then run DummyRepeater with DISPLAY=:0 dummyrepeater

You can automate this.
This is outside of the scope of these notes.

Remote Control:
remotecontrold "N4IRS B" link 15 "REF001 C"

Which links N4IRS B to REF001 C with a 15 minute reconnect timer.

Other valid command formats are:

remotecontrold "N4IRS  B" unlink
remotecontrold "N4IRS  B" link never "REF001 C"
remotecontrold "N4IRS  B" link fixed "REF001 C"

You can also default ircDDBGateway to connect at startup by editing reflector1 in the ircddbgateway config file reflector1=REF001 C
